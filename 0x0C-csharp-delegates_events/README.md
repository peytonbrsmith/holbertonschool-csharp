0x0C. C\# - Delegates, Events
=============================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google** :

### General

-   What are delegates and how to use them
-   What are anonymous methods and how to use them
-   What is multicasting
-   What is the difference between delegates and interfaces
-   What is a callback
-   What are events and how to use them
-   What is asynchronous programming

Requirements
------------

### General

-   Allowed editors: `        Visual Studio Code       `
-   All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using
    `        dotnet       `
-   A `        README.md       ` file, at the root of the folder of the
    project, is mandatory
-   **You can organize and name your files as you like for this
    project** , just ensure you do not push a file containing a
    `        Main       ` method, it may conflict with our testing
    files.
-   Each C\# task requires its own folder and `        .csproj       `
    file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names
    on the folders are correct
-   You do not need to push your `        obj/       ` or
    `        bin/       ` folders
-   In the following examples, the `        main.cs       ` files are
    shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you
    don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them
    into account). We will use our own `        main.cs       ` files at
    compilation. Our `        main.cs       ` files might be different
    from the one shown in the examples
-   All your public classes and their members should have XML
    documentation tags
-   All your private classes and members should be documented but
    without XML documentation tags
