0x0D. C\# - Text-based Interface
================================

In this project, we’ll be using all of the collective Foundations and
C\# skills you’ve gained to create a console application that allows a
user to manage inventories of items.

-   Data will be stored in JSON format
-   Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete objects
-   The class and attribute names used in this application will be
    generic, making it versatile for different use cases and easily
    extended

This project is more flexible than previous console application
projects. The checker will not be looking for specific output; instead,
the majority of your application will be manually reviewed. This means
that you will not be given specifics on exactly how things should be
printed or how input is taken. This reflects how you may need to
approach projects as a software engineer in the industry. You won’t
always be given specifications to follow to the letter – you’ll need to
be able to make your own informed, logical decisions about an
application’s functionality. Some key things you should consider when
creating the console application:

-   How should the application take properties for a new or updated
    object? Should it be done in one line? Or should there be a
    secondary prompt after their initial create/update command? How else
    can this be implemented?
-   What’s a readable way to display an object in the terminal?
-   Should there be a confirmation prompt for deleting objects?
-   What commands require error messages? What should an error message
    contain in order to be useful?
-   What should be done to make your Github repo informative and useful
    for other contributors and users of this application?

Requirements
------------

### C\# Tasks

-   Allowed editors: `        Visual Studio Code       `
-   All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using
    `        dotnet       `
-   A `        README.md       ` file, at the root of the folder of the
    project, is mandatory
-   All default C\# files named `        Program.cs       ` should be
    renamed to the name given in each task
-   You do not need to push your `        obj/       ` or
    `        bin/       ` folders
-   All your public classes and their members should have XML
    documentation tags
-   All your private classes and members should be documented but
    without XML documentation tags

### C\# Tests

-   Allowed editors: `        Visual Studio Code       `
-   All tests should be inside a separate folder
-   All your test files will be executed using
    `        dotnet test       `
-   We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you
    don’t miss any edge cases

### For this project:

-   Based on the requirements of each task, you should write the
    documentation and tests first before you actually code anything
-   The intranet checks for C\# projects won’t be released before their
    first deadline in order for you to focus more on TDD and thinking
    about all possible cases
-   We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you
    don’t miss any edge cases
-   **Don’t trust the user** , always think about all possible edge
    cases
